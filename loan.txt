. Project focuses on bank loan data analysis and prediction using machine learning techniques.

. Dataset is loaded, inspected, and preprocessed by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand patterns and data distribution.

. Multiple ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM are implemented.

. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

. Comparative analysis is done to identify the best-performing model.

. The project concludes with insights to improve bank loan approval decisions
