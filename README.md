# bank-loan-analysis
It analyzes  bank loan dataset to predict loan approval using machine learning techniques. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model training. The project evaluates different classifiers to automate loan approval decisions based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, and property area.
# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data and predicting loan approval status using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to help financial institutions make accurate and data-driven loan approval decisions.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer details such as demographic information, income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant financial attributes. It is used to classify whether a loan should be approved or not.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection and data cleaning

Splitting data into training and testing sets

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to:

Understand data distribution

Identify patterns and correlations

Visualize important features affecting loan approval

# Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-score


A comparative analysis is done to identify the best-performing model for predicting loan approval with higher accuracy and reliability.
